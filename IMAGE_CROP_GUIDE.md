# Image Cropping Guide

## Current Issue
The `founder.jpg` file contains both the photo of Naheed Hussain and a graphic overlay. We need to crop it to show only the photo portion.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Crop the Image File (Recommended)
1. **Open the image** in any image editor (Paint, Photoshop, GIMP, online tools)
2. **Crop the image** to show only the top portion (Naheed Hussain's photo)
3. **Save as** `founder.jpg` (replace the existing file)
4. **Recommended size**: 400x400 pixels or larger

### Option 2: Use Online Cropping Tools
- **Canva**: Upload and crop the image
- **Pixlr**: Free online image editor
- **Fotor**: Simple cropping tool
- **CropCircle**: For circular crops

### Option 3: Use a Different Image
If cropping doesn't work:
1. **Take a new photo** of Naheed Hussain
2. **Save as** `founder.jpg`
3. **Ensure it's** a professional headshot or speaking photo

## What to Crop
- **Keep**: The top portion showing Naheed Hussain speaking at the podium
- **Remove**: The bottom graphic with the gradient background and text overlay
- **Result**: Clean photo of Naheed Hussain only

## After Cropping
1. Replace the existing `founder.jpg` file
2. Refresh the website
3. The photo should display properly without the composite overlay

## Alternative CSS Solution
If cropping isn't possible, we can try more aggressive CSS masking, but cropping the image file is the cleanest solution.
