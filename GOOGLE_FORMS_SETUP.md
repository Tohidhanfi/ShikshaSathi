3. Replace the placeholder URLs in `index.html`:
   ```javascript
   const GOOGLE_FORMS = {
       tutor: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_TUTOR_FORM_URL',
       school: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_SCHOOL_FORM_URL',
       parentStudent: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_PARENT_FORM_URL'
   };
   ```

#### **2.2 Get Field IDs**
1. In each form, right-click on a field and "Inspect Element"
2. Look for `name="entry.1234567890"` - this is the field ID
3. Replace all placeholder field IDs in `index.html`:
   ```javascript
   const FORM_FIELDS = {
       tutor: {
           fullName: 'entry.ACTUAL_ID_HERE',
           gender: 'entry.ACTUAL_ID_HERE',
           // ... continue for all fields
