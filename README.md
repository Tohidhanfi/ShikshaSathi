## How to Use

### For Users (Form Submission)
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Click one of the registration buttons:
   - "Register as a Tutor"
   - "Register as a Partner School"
   - "Register as a Parent/Student"
3. A Google Form opens in a new tab. Complete and submit the form there.
4. Submissions are stored in the corresponding Google Form/Sheet.

Note: The in-page modals and local storage submission flow described below are inactive when Google Forms redirection is enabled.

## Google Forms Navigation

The following buttons in `index.html` open Google Forms:

- Tutor Registration: `https://forms.gle/FdpQ2G7GUagdjFht5`
- Partner School Registration: `https://forms.gle/UnnpivhYwQBAZywj8`
- Parent/Student Registration: `https://forms.gle/FjxPLqaXu1r1ThedA`

Where to update URLs in `index.html`:

- Hero section buttons
- Join Us section cards

Buttons use `window.open` in their `onclick` attributes. Example:

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="window.open('https://forms.gle/XXXXXXXX', '_blank')">
  Register as a Tutor
</button>
```

Replace `https://forms.gle/XXXXXXXX` with your actual Google Form link for each button.
